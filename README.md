# Relif: a relation algebra model finder

[Relation algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_algebra) are algebras arising from the study of binary relations. They form a part of the field of algebraic logic, and have applications in proof theory, modal logic, and computer science. 
An interesting problem in relation algebras is the so called _representation problem_, which amounts to give a canonical representation of a given relation algebra, in the form of binary relations. This problem doesn't have a solution for all algebras. 

#### Relif is a specification tool inspired by the [Alloy Analyzer](https://alloytools.org/) that allows the user to explore relation algebras satisfying a set of constraints defined by the user, and provides a way of looking for representations.

This project is part of my master's thesis for Software Engineering at Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Buenos Aires. The document describing the theory and motivation behind the tool (as well as its behavior) [can be downloaded here](paper.pdf). 
Chapter 3 explains how Relif works, describing its grammar and providing examples.
